# Design patterns - Examples in Java

These examples are being used in a class about Object-oriented design.

## Folder structure

Each folder demonstrates another design pattern.

Some folders contain before and after folders. In the before folder we can see the code before
applying the pattern and in the after folder we can see the refactored code.

## Suggested sequence of working with the examples

- Adapter
- Strategy
- Factory Method

## Exercises

In some patterns there is also a docs folder with some more info about the pattern and exercises for practice.
